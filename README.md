Unwrap image from a parabolic mirror to create a panorama

Images taken with "lenses" like these: http://www.0-360.com/ or http://www.pano-pro.com/
need to be processed by "unwrapping" them into a 360 degree panorama. 

This script takes as input the raw image, plus the x,y coordinates of the center pixel
and will output a panoramic image of the specified size.
